We have moved to GitLab because GitHub proved to be less reliable

You can find us at our new home: https://gitlab.com/Linux-Is-Best/Firefox-automatic-install-for-Linux

For those who do not read documentation, they are weclome to still run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x Setup.sh
```

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run).  Next, execute the script by type the following.

```bash
bash Setup.sh
```
   
   (Or your perfered shell followed by Setup.sh)

Follow the prompt and remember to update your URL https://gitlab.com/Linux-Is-Best/Firefox-automatic-install-for-Linux
