For those who do not read documentation, they are weclome to still run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x Setup.sh
```

This will make the script executable (allowing it to run).  Next, execute the script by type the following.

```bash
bash Setup.sh
```
   
   (Or your perfered shell followed by Setup.sh)
